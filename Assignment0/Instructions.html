            1) .txt files must have answers for each question of the form "0A1B2C..." (with the letter after the number being the multiple choice answer of the respective question) with the initial question number being 0 and there being 10 total different question numbers (i.e. starting with 0 and the last one being 9). All question numbers must be entered, even if with a whitespace answer. Answers must be capitalized. <br><br> 2) .csv files are similar to above, with the difference being that they must have the question number and answer in each subsequent column so that the .csv has 1 row and 20 columns (10 for each question number and its respective answer). <br><br> Note: If these instructions are unclear, a sample .csv and .txt for answers is included with the files under the names "tester.txt" and "testerCSV.csv" <br><br>
