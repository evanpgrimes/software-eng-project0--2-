Admin checks requests, adds and deletes users, and uploads answer key to be checked against users' file uploads. Users upload their file that they want to be checked against file that admin currently has uploaded and user receives corresponding grade. Guests can request to have an account created for them so they can gain the ability to login and upload their assignment file. <br><br>
            
            Note: Functionality of the program only allows one assignment to be graded at a time until the admin updates the answer key (by uploading a new file). <br><br>
